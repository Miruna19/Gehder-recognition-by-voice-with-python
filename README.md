## About project
In this project, we aim to perform speaker gender detection. The human voice represents a signal with infinite information; in addition to emotions and dialect, we can also identify a person's gender using the vocal characteristics of the signal.

## The dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/primaryobjects/voicegender
The code presents a pre-existing database, which includes 20 parameters extracted from voice samples, offering insight into the acoustic characteristics of the human voice. The database contains several voice samples, each of which is actually a .WAV file. The files have been preprocessed for acoustic analysis. The preprocessed WAV files have been saved in a CSV file. The file contains 3,168 rows and 21 columns. The 21st column indicates the gender, either # male or female.
