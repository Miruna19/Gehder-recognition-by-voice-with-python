Instructions for Using the Code:

To open the project, you need to install an application capable of running Python code, or you can use Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/, which requires signing in with your Google account.
Import the database, which is a .csv file containing vocal samples from multiple individuals. It is a preprocessed database with specific acoustic features extracted for gender classification.
Execute each cell in chronological order; skipping any cell will result in an error.
Observe the output of each cell and interpret the results.
At line 139, insert an audio file containing the desired voice recording.
Continue running the code.
Finally, you will be able to view the desired result (gender detection: female/male).
